# Download data

From BaseSpace on BU's SCC:

```{bash}
#working directory:
pwd
#/projectnb/davieslab/nicpro/thermvar/genexp
module load basespace-cli
bs auth
#output said this: 
#Please go to this URL to authenticate: URL 
#So I did that & it worked
bs download project -i 295384090 -o .
#note from a different time: I didn't see where to get the project ID from except from the end of the URL of the page:
#https://basespace.illumina.com/analyses/467998258?projectId=295384090

#now all the files are in their own folder for some reason, so copying them out of it to a new data directory:
mkdir fastq_raw
for dir in SA*/
do
	echo $dir
	cp $dir/*.fastq.gz ./fastq_raw
done

#tar/zip the raw folders
tar -cvzf illumina_things.tar.gz SA*
```
